    <h2>Proposition: The availability of abortion clinics significantly influences the abortion rate across states.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This chart presents the shocking relationship between the change in the number of abortion clinics and 
					the increasing abortion rates by state, from 2017 to 2020. The size of each bubble represents the state's 
					share of total U.S. abortions in 2020. The trend line demonstrates how strongly the increase in clinics 
					is associated with increases in abortion rates.
				</figcaption>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Black Background:</b> The idea I had with the black background was to create a stark, serious atmosphere in a way that it 
					would be used to make other colors pop, especially contrasting colors like red. My hope was that it would help to elicit 
					an emotional response, given the context (abortion), as it may subconsciously convey a negative connotation. Another thing
					is that the black background "breaks" the edge of the chart, allowing the trend line to continue following outside of it (-1.5).
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<b>Blood Splash:</b> The "blood splash" was designed to provoke a visceral/emotional reaction from the viewer. 
					It directly associates the data with blood, which can be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to frame 
					the issue of abortion in a graphic and negative light. The most interesting part is that it adds an 
					editorial slant that is not part of the data itself, and it was placed right at the tip of the arrow 
					to catch the viewer's attention, making it quite deceptive (-2).
				</li>

				<li>
					<b>Sensationalist Title, Caption, and Axes Labels:</b> My goal was to create the most persuasive visualization 
					possible. With that goal in mind, I tried not to open margins for the viewers to think about other possible
					 interpretations of the chart before they even examined it. The title and labels played a crucial role in 
					 this aim. I tried to be very sensationalist with the title. I added the words "Escalation" and "Expansion" 
					 to the axes labels to "exaggerate" the side of the proposition that this visualization is supporting not taking 
					 into account that many data points do not actually show the focused trend (-2). 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Data Labels:</b> I added the labels only to specific states where we can see the increase of abortion rate together 
					with the increase in the number of clinics to intentionally induce the viewer to pay attention to them. Not surprisingly, 
					the labeled data points are in the quadrant where the viewer also finds the "blood splash," the annotation, and the tip 
					of the trendline (-1).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Annotations:</b> I decided to add the annotation to translate the regression coefficients in a more accessible manner 
					to the viewer to give more context to the narrative supported by this visualization that emphasizes the trendline (-1).
				</li>

				<li>
					<b>Bubble Chart Instead of a Scatter Plot:</b> I could also have used a simple scatter plot to present this data, but 
					instead, I used the bubble chart to add more information to the chart and persuade the viewer to think that this is 
					another piece of evidence that shows that the increasing number of clinics is associated with the abortion rate, 
					making the visualization more "crowded" (-0.5).
				</li>
				
				<br>
				
				In the appendix it is possible to see other iterations of the visualization where other design choices where made until we get 
				to the one presented above.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
			<img src="images/fig2_v4.png" alt="" width="1000" />
			<figcaption>
				This panel shows the increase in abortion rates across various states from 2017 to 2020, 
				despite changes in the number of abortion clinics available. 
				On the top part of the panel, each bar represents a state's percentage increase in 
				abortion rates, clearly demonstratingthat abortion rates has rised regardless of 
				the availability of clinics. 
				On the bottom part of the panel, we demystify the nonexisting relationship between the change in 
				the number of abortion clinics and the increasing abortion rates by state. 
				Each bubble represents an state, and its size represents the state's share of total 
				U.S. abortions in 2020.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Data, Axes Scale, and Trend Lines:</b> In the upper part of the panel, the bar chart selectively highlights 
					states that have increasing abortion rates despite fewer clinics. The data data was filtered to focus on states
					 with no change or decrease in clinics but an increase in abortion rates. This presentation, however, definitely lacks 
					comprehensive context and only accounts for a partial representation of the data, thereby presenting an incomplete 
					narrative. It is also important to note that we are only presenting data regarding the abortion rate and nothing 
					about the number of available clinics and how this number has changed. In the lower part of the panel, the bubble 
					visualization offers a strikingly different perspective from its counterpart that implies a correlation between 
					clinic availability and abortion rates. Here, the application of a logarithmic scale on both axes effectively 
					compresses variations in the data, masking any trends, particularly because it obscures the states where clinic 
					expansion rates have decreased or remained static. It also excludes the trend line presented in the earlier visualization, 
					further emphasizing the absence of a discernible pattern and suggesting no clear relationship between the number of 
					clinics and abortion rate changes (-2).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sensationalist Title, Caption, and Axes Labels:</b> As in the previous visualization, the panel's 
					title and axes labels were designed to exclusively support one side of the narrative in a wildly exaggerated, 
					persuasive, and sensationalist way. The intentional choice of making the labels of the axes the same as the 
					"FOR the Proposition" visualization allows the viewer to have this second panel as a direct comparative point 
					with the first visualization, possibly making it more intuitive for them to say, "Wait a minute, what is going 
					on here?! I just saw a similar visualization that was claiming..." (-2).  
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Annotations:</b> In the upper part of the panel, the annotation "Nearly 1 in 3 states show higher abortion rates 
					despite the number of clinics" was designed to be straightforward and persuasive to make the viewer focus on the chart's 
					narrative. The word "Nearly" was included to smooth the fact that the 15 states presented actually represent 29% of t She 
					states, not 1/3, and the "blood splash" was used to bring to the visualization an emotional aspect. Besides that, the 
					abortion rate numbers were placed on top of each bar with arrows pointing up to catch the viewer's attention to the 
					"escalation phenomenon". In the lower part of the panel, the annotation "No clear association between clinic expansion 
					rate and abortion rate changes" was added to the chart in a horizontal position right below the data points to emphasize 
					the trend's nonexistence. Moreover, data labels were added only to the same data points labeled on the counterpart chart, 
					possibly making the viewer even more intrigued (-1.5). 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Background colors</b>: Similar to the counterpart visualization, the upper part of the panel is black to imply a 
					serious/emotional atmosphere. The black again also helped me to contrast the red of the "blood splash" behind the 
					annotation and the color of the bars. In contrast to that, given that the lower part of the panel was designed more 
					exclusively to contrast the visualization that supports the proposition and not show focus on the "dark side" of the 
					narrative, I decided to change the black background back to a soft color (-1.5). 
				</li>

				<br>

				In the appendix it is possible to see other iterations of the visualization where other design choices where made until we get 
				to the one presented above.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		Reflecting on the creation of both visualizations, it's clear to me now that the line between persuasive and deceptive data visualization is 
		razor-thin. Crafting these two charts was a lesson in the power of subtle visual cues and design choices that can completely alter a narrative. 
		I learned that the same data could be framed in vastly different lights, all depending on the story I wanted to tell. I was surprised by how 
		even minor adjustments to elements like a color scheme or axis labeling could drastically change the impression the data made on an audience.
		Moreover, this assignment allowed me to constantly draw parallels with the challenges we face nowadays with fake news and misinformation. By 
		being aware of these deceptive techniques in practice will definitely help me to critically evaluate things from now on.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I would define ethics in the visualization context as probably one of the most challenging things. Even though for me it could be summarized as 
		the practice of presenting data in a way that is true to its nature while ensuring the audience can understand it without being misled, it is extremely 
		hard to maintain the integrity of the data without inserting personal bias or allowing design choices to distort the reality it represents. 
		It's not just about not lying with the data; it's about not allowing the data to lie to us.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		To distinguish between "acceptable" persuasive choices and "misleading" ones, I believe we must ask if the visualization helps the 
		viewer make an informed decision or leads them toward a predetermined conclusion. For me, acceptable persuasion clarifies complex data, 
		provides the necessary context, and highlights genuine patterns and relationships. However, on the other hand, misleading persuasion obscures, 
		omits, or distorts information to provoke a specific emotional or intellectual response that is not justified by the data itself. 
		If a visualization remains faithful to the data while making it more understandable, it is ethical. However, if the design 
		manipulates the data to serve an agenda, it crosses the line into deception. As a visual communicator, I now see the profound 
		responsibility I hold and the ethical considerations I must adhere to in order to respect both the data and its audience.
